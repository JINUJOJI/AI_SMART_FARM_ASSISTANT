This tool is here to help farm workers make better decisions about their crops by 
using artificial intelligence and the evaluation of information. By studying a wide 
number of factors such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and many other 
key conditions, the model accurately predicts the degree to which a crop is healthy 
or specifically recommends the best crops to grow. The system takes actual farm 
data, tidies it up, processes it, along with training a machine learning model 
(Random Forest Classifier) to recognize many patterns and create precise 
predictions. With this, farmers can: 
Recognize when crops are unhealthy quickly and then act decisively to prevent 
wide-ranging harm. To cut down on waste, use water, fertilizers, along with other 
resources in an efficient way. 
Make many informed decisions. Base these decisions on real-time farm 
conditions. 
This tool helps farmers increase their yields to a great extent, substantially reduce 
risks, and make farming more sustainable and profitable to a large degree in the 
long run by using AI in agriculture.
